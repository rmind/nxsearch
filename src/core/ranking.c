	 * TF-IDF intuition:
	 *
	 * 1) Term Frequency: "The weight of a term that occurs in a document
	 * is simply proportional to the term frequency" (H P Luhn, 1957).
	 *
	 * 2) Inverse Document Frequency: "The specificity of a term can be
	 * quantified as an inverse function of the number of documents in
	 * which it occurs" (K S Jones, 1972).
	 *
	 * Formula:
	 *
	 *	tf-idf(t, d, D) = tf(t, d) * idf(t, D)
	 *
	 *	t - term, d - document, D - all documents,
	 *	N = len(D) - the number of documents
	 *
	 * There are different weighting schemes in literature, e.g. what
	 * logarithm to apply on IDF, whether smoothen TF with square root
	 * or logarithm, etc.  We will use:
	 *
	 *	TF <- tf(t, d) = log(term_freq(t, d))
	 *	IDF <- idf(t, D) = 1 + log(N / doc_freq(t))
	 *
	 * We sum the scores of multiple terms, e.g. "cats AND dogs",
	 * if they are in the given document.
