/*
 * Levenshtein distance.
 *
 * It is a for metric measuring the difference between two strings,
 * defined as: the minimum number of mutations required to change one
 * string into the other.  Levenshtein distance mutations are removal,
 * insertion and substitution.
 *
 * Simple recursive algorithm (in Python):
 *
 *	def lev_dist(a, b):
 *	    if len(a) == 0: return len(b)
 *	    if len(b) == 0: return len(a)
 *	    cost = int(a[0] != b[0])
 *	    return min(
 *	        lev_dist(a[1:], b) + 1,         # removal
 *	        lev_dist(a, b[1:]) + 1,         # insertion
 *	        lev_dist(a[1:], b[1:]) + cost,  # substitution
 *	    )
 *
 * The actual implementation is based on the optimized version of the
 * Wagnerâ€“Fischer algorithm which.  Instead of the full matrix, it uses
 * only the relevant row and two variables necessary to compute the
 * final value.
